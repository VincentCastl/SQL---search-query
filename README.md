# SQL -FORMAT-queries

This GitHub repository contains code samples that demonstrate how to run create a query that runs several query formats into just one.
It can be achieved through SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure Synapse, and Azure SQL Edge.
Each sample includes a README file that explains how to run and use the sample.

Note that certain features like In-Memory OLTP are edition specific for SQL Server and would be possible to implement if the edition which supports that feature is being used to run the sample.
